# Project information

This app is built with Hono, Cloudflare Workers, and regular css. Only edit styles in the ./public/app.css file (don't edit the other ./public/*.css files).
Use server side pages with sever side jsx to implement features and UI. Avoid client side javascript unless absolutely necessary. If writing client side javascript do so in a separate .js file in ./public/ dir and write with vanilla browser javascript. Use HTMX if you need to do any client side interactivity. But in most cases a regular server side page link will be okay and even HTMX will not be needed. Do not use React or other client side frameworks.
